Atom	* [[Alpha decay]] is when the atom shoots out a particle having two protons and two neutrons. This is essentially a [[helium]] nucleus. The result is an element with atomic number two less than before. So for example if a [[beryllium]] atom (atomic number 4) went through alpha decay it would become helium (atomic number 2). Alpha decay happens when an atom is too big and needs to get rid of some mass.\n* [[Beta decay]] is when a neutron turns into a proton or a proton turns into a neutron. In the first case the atom shoots out an electron. In the second case it is a [[positron]] (like an electron but with a positive charge). The end result is an element with one higher or one lower atomic number than before. Beta decay happens when an atom has either too many protons, or too many neutrons.\n* [[Gamma ray|Gamma decay]] is when an atom shoots out a [[gamma ray]], or wave. It happens when there is a change in the [[energy]] of the nucleus. This is usually after a nucleus has already gone through alpha or beta decay. There is no change in the mass, or atomic number or the atom, only in the stored energy inside the nucleus.

Astronomy	* [[Telescopes]] are the main tool of observing. They take all the light in a big area and put in into a small area. This is like making your eyes very big and powerful. Astronomers use telescopes to look at things that are far away and dim. Telescopes make objects look bigger, closer, brighter. \n* [[Spectrometer]]s study the different [[wavelength]]s of light. This shows what something is made of. \n* Many telescopes are in satellites. They are [[space observatory|space observatories]]. The Earth’s [[atmosphere]] blocks some parts of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], but special telescopes  above the atmosphere can detect that radiation.

Cosmology	*[[String theory]]\n*[[Earth science|Earth Science]]\n*[[Inflation (cosmology)|Inflation]]
Church_(building)	* The '''[[nave]]''' is the main part of the church where the congregation (the people who come to worship) sit. \n* The '''aisles''' are the sides of the church which may run along the side of the nave.\n* The '''transept''', if there is one, is an area which crosses the nave near the top of the church. This makes the church shaped like a cross, which is a symbol of [[Jesus]]'s death on a [[crucifix|cross]].\n* The '''chancel''' leads up to the [[altar]] at the top of the church. The altar is in the '''sanctuary'''. The word “[[sanctuary]]” means “sacred place”. People were not allowed to be [[arrest]]ed in the sanctuary, so they were safe. The altar is usually at the [[east]] end of the church. People in the church sit facing the altar. We say that the church “faces east”.\n* Churches will also have a '''tower''' or [[steeple]], usually at the west end. If the church has a transept the tower may be above the centre of the transept.
Church_(building)	* The [[Saxon architecture|Saxon]] period ([[7th century|700]]–[[1050]]) was a time when churches were very simple. The end of the church (end of the sanctuary) was often rounded. Hardly any are left now because they were mostly made of [[wood]].\n* The [[Norman architecture|Norman]] period ([[1050]]–[[1190]]) came from the style called [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] which was popular in Europe. The arches had ornaments which were called “mouldings”. The tops of the pillars looked like [[cushion]]s, so they were called “cushion capitals”. The windows were narrow and rounded at the top.\n* [[Early English architecture|Early English]] or [[Gothic architecture]] ([[1190]]–[[1280]]) was not as solid and heavy as Norman architecture. Towers were elegant and tall, like the tower of [[Salisbury Cathedral]].\n* The [[Decorated architecture|Decorated]] style of architecture ([[1280]]–[[1360]])was popular at a time when the [[plague]] (Black Death) was raging and a third of the people in England died. For that reason, not so much building was done then. There were lots of stone carvings were made in churches at that time.\n* The [[Perpendicular architecture|Perpendicular]] style ([[1360]]–[[1540]]) was very grand. It had lots of straight upward lines and [[fan vaulting]]. This can be seen in [[Westminster Abbey]] and [[King's College Chapel, Cambridge]]. Many churches that can be seen in England were built in this period.

City	"* A long [[history]]. Although many cities today have only been around for tens or hundreds of years, there are a few which have been so for thousands of years. For example, [[Athens]], [[Greece]] was founded in 1000 [[BC]] and [[Rome]], [[Italy]] has existed since 700 BC.\n* A large [[population]]. Cities can have millions of people living in and around them. Among them are [[Tokyo]], [[Japan]], and the [[Tokyo Metropolis]] around it, which includes [[Yokohama]] and [[Chiba]].\n* In Japan, the population of a city ( 市 ) is at least over 50,000 persons.<ref>{{Cite web|title=総務省｜地方自治制度｜地方公共団体の区分|url=https://www.soumu.go.jp/main_sosiki/jichi_gyousei/bunken/chihou-koukyoudantai_kubun.html|access-date=2020-08-20|website=総務省|language=ja}}</ref> and among cities, there are various grades according to laws, which the central government of Japan governs.\n* A center where [[business]] and [[government]] takes place. The first case is often described as the [[financial capital]], such as [[Frankfurt]] in [[Germany]]. The second case is true for different levels of government, whether they are local or part of a larger [[region]] (for example, [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], or the capital of the United States [[Washington, D.C.]]) Cities that contain the government of the region it is in are called capitals. Almost every country has its own capital.\n* Special powers called [[town privileges]] which have been given by the government of the [[country]] or its [[ruler]]. [[Europe]] during the [[Middle Ages]] was a great example of having town privileges.\n* Having a [[cathedral]] or a [[university]]. This rule is found in the United Kingdom. The smallest ""cathedral cities"" are [[St. David's]] and [[St. Asaph's]] which are both in [[Wales]], [[Ripon]] and [[Wells]] which are in [[England]]."

Diarrhea	* Unsafe drinking water.  Bacteria, viruses, and parasites often get into the water, which people then have to drink.  Anyone who drinks the water can then get an infection that causes diarrhea.\n* [[Sanitation]], with clean toilets, is often not available.  This makes it easier for infections to spread.\n* Clean water and soap for washing hands are often not available, either.  If people cannot wash their hands, bacteria, viruses, or parasites can stay on their hands.  These microbes can then enter the mouth or get spread to other people with handshaking.

Ethics	* What [[action]]s are [[good]]? What actions are [[evil]]?\n* How can we tell the [[difference]]?\n* Are good and evil the same?\n* How should we make hard [[decision]]s that might help or [[hurt]] other [[people]]?\n* How do our actions affect others?
Ethics	* [[thinking]] about [[morality]],\n* the involvement of [[science]], \n* the [[freedom]] of people to decide for themselves how to [[act]] within their own [[belief]]s.
Ethics	* Ethics is part of the study of [[religion]]. In religion, people often learn what is good or bad from what they believe about [[God]] (or gods). Some important ideas about what is good or bad have come from religion. See [[Ten Commandments]].\n* Some theories of [[economics]] say ethics has to do with [[money]]. Money is a big part of most people's lives. Thinking about morality can be important in economics. For example, there is a saying about ethics taken from the [[Bible]] that 'the [[love]] of money is the root of all kinds of [[evil]]' (1 Timothy).The philosophy of [[Marxism]] also says that a few people using money in the wrong way can hurt many other people.\n* Government policy can be affected by what [[politics|politicians]] think is ethical. Politicians try to create [[laws]] that help everyone do what is right. Political debates happen when the people who make public policy do not agree about what is right.\n* In [[work]], thinking about ethics can help with hard questions. Work can be like both economics and politics. Workers have to make money and follow laws. But the best way to do both is not always easy to know. The study of this is called business ethics\n* People like [[Medical doctor|doctors]] and [[nurse]]s have to make [[wikt:hard|hard]] choices about how to [[health care|care]] for people. Sometimes the person being cared for, their [[family]] or the doctor do not agree what is best for them. Also, choices have to be made if there are enough [[resource]]s to help all. The study of this is called [[medical ethics]]. [[Similar]] studies for specific professions include [[bioethics]] and legal ethics.\n* Discussing ethics can also be a way to stop people fighting or starting a war. By talking about ethics, people hope to get what they want without being [[violent]]. This works when all people [[agree]] that [[peace]] is very important. But not everyone agrees about what is right or wrong. So, sometimes anger can make it hard to talk without [[fighting]].

Economics	"* All people have to decide between their options.\n* The [[cost]] of goods is what a person gives up for the [[goods]].\n* When a person gives up something (like money) to get a good, they also give up other things that they could have gotten instead. This means that the true cost of something is what you give up to get it. This includes [[money]], and the [[economic]] benefits (""utility"") that you didn't get because you can no longer buy something else.This is called [[opportunity cost]].\n* People choose between options based on the rewards (""incentives"") or bad things (""disincentives"") they expect from each option. Adding to the rewards for an option will often make more people choose it.\n* Trade can make everyone better off.\n* Markets are usually good for the organisation of economic life. In the [[free market]], goods will be shared by people and companies making small decisions. The “invisible hand” of the market ([[Adam Smith]]) states that if everyone tries to get what they want, everyone will be as well-off as they could possibly be.\n* Sometimes prices do not fully show the cost or benefit to society. For example, [[air pollution]] is bad for society, and education is good for society. The government can put a tax (or do something to reduce sales) on items that are bad for [[society]]. It can also support (like giving money for) items that are good for society.\n* The living standard of a country depends on the skills to produce services and goods. Productivity is the amount of the produced goods divided by total working hours. \n* When there is an increase in the total money supply, or when the cost to [[produce]] things rises, prices go up. This is called [[inflation]]."

Execution	* '''[[Hanging (death)|Hanging]]''': Using a rope to either break the convict's neck or to choke (or [[strangle]]) them.  Widely used around the world until the 20th century. Still today in use in some countries, such as [[Iraq]], [[Singapore]] and [[Japan]].\n* '''Firing Squad''':  Several people shoot and kill a person.  Armies around the world have long used this method, since guns and bullets are readily available.  Firing squad was the lawful means of execution in [[Finland]] until 1944, when death penalty was abolished (stopped by the law).  It was also used in the state of [[Utah]] in the 20th century.  In most cases, not all the shooters have real bullets.  After the execution, it is not possible to determine which of the people firing killed the person just executed.\n* '''[[Gas chamber]]''': killing a person by filling the air in a room with [[poison gas]] until the person cannot breathe and dies.  This method was used for executions in some U.S. states, and for [[mass murder]] by the [[Schutzstaffel]] during [[the Holocaust]].
Execution	*'''[[Lethal injection]]''': Killing a person by placing poisons into their [[bloodstream]]. This is the choice of execution in most U.S. states that allow executions.\n*'''Electrocution''': Killing a person by placing them in an [[electric chair]] and giving them a very high electric shock.
Execution	"*'''[[Crucifixion]]''': a person (or their [[corpse]]) is fixed to a [[timber]] by [[Nail|nails]] or by [[impalement]]. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] used crucifixion to punish traitors, rebels and runaway slaves because the Romans considered it the most unpleasant death. Death by this method may take days. Besides [[ancient Greece]], [[ancient Rome]], and the Persian empires, this method was also used in feudal Japan.\n*'''Drawing and Quartering''':  A very violent form of execution common in Medieval and Renaissance Europe. It involved taking a person's organs out while he was still alive, then tying them to four horses going in different directions until their body is torn apart.  \n*'''""Breaking on the wheel""''', the executioner breaks all the bones of a person's [[Limb|limbs]] with a heavy object. The executioner wraps the person's limbs around a wheel from a [[carriage]], and lifts the wheel to the top of a tall pole. Slowly, the person dies.\n*'''Crushing''', also called '''pressing''': used in the [[common law]] legal systems. A [[defendant]] who refused to plead (""stood mute"") would be subjected to having heavier and heavier [[stone]]s placed upon their [[chest]] until a plea was entered or the person [[Suffocation|suffocated]].\n*'''[[Garrote|Garroting]]''', a method of strangulation used in [[Spain]] for hundreds of years."

Geometry	* the surface area of a [[house]], so they can buy the right amount of [[paint]]\n* the [[volume]] of a [[box]], to see if it is big enough to hold a [[litre|liter]] of [[food]]\n* the area of a [[farm]], so it can be divided into equal parts\n* the [[distance]] around the [[edge]] of a [[pond]], to know how much [[fence|fencing]] to [[buy]].
Geometry	* A '''[[point (geometry)|point]]''' is shown on [[paper]] by [[touch]]ing it with a [[pencil]] or [[pen]], without making any sideways movement. We know where the point is, but it has no [[size]].\n* A '''[[straight]] [[line]]''' is the [[short]]est [[distance]] between two points. For example, Sophie pulls a piece of [[wikt:string|string]] from one point to another point. A straight line between the two points will follow the [[wikt:path|path]] of the tight string.\n* A '''[[Plane (mathematics)|plane]]''' is a flat [[surface]] that does not [[wikt:stop|stop]] in any [[direction]]. For example, imagine a wall that extends in all directions infinitely.
Graph_theory	* What is the best way for a [[mailman]] to get to all of the [[house]]s in the area in the least amount of [[time]]? The points could represent [[street]] corners and lines could represent the houses along the street. (see [[Chinese postman problem]])\n* A salesman has to visit different customers, but wants to keep the distance traveled as small as possible. The problem is to find a way so they can do it. This problem is known as [[Travelling Salesman Problem]] (and often abbreviated ''TSP''). It is among the hardest problems to solve. If a commonly believed [[conjecture]] is true (described as '''P''' ≠ '''NP'''), then an exact solution requires one to try all possible routes to find which is shortest.\n* How many colors would be needed to color a map, if countries sharing a border are colored differently? The points could represent the different areas and the lines could represent that two areas are neighboring. (look at the [[Four color theorem]])\n* Can a sketch be drawn in one closed line? The lines of the drawing are the lines of the graph and when two or more lines collide, there is a point in the graph. The task is now to find a way through the graph using each line one time. (look at [[Seven Bridges of Königsberg]])
Graph_theory	* Graph theory has many aspects. Graphs can be directed or undirected. An example of a directed graph would be the system of roads in a city. Some streets in the city are one way streets. This means, that on those parts there is only one direction to follow.\n* Graphs can be weighted. An example would be a road network, with distances, or with [[toll]]s (for roads).\n* The nodes (the circles in the schematic) of a graph are called [[vertex|vertices]]. The lines connecting the nodes are called [[edge]]s. There can be no line between two nodes, there can be one line, or there can be multiple lines.\n* In graph theory, Trees structures are widely used, they represent [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] structures. A Tree is a directed or undirected graph where there is no cycle, meaning: no way of going from one vertex (for example a town) to the same one using each edge you use only once (walking only once on each road you take).

Human_body	* [[Biology]] is a field of [[science]]. It studies living things. It looks at how the human body works. It studies how the human body came from [[evolution]]. It studies how [[genetics]] makes the human body.\n** [[Anatomy]] studies the parts of the body and how they work together.\n** [[Ecology]] studies the environment including how humans affect it.\n*[[Physical anthropology]] is a field of science.  It compares humans to other [[hominid]]s.  It also studies all other hominid bodies.  They look at how [[human]]s and [[chimpanzee]]s are the same or different.\n* [[Psychology]] is a field of [[medicine]]. It looks at how people think and feel. The [[brain]] is part of the body. How we think and feel comes from the brain. So psychologists study the body. They study how the brain lets us be who we are.\n* [[Religion]] also talks about the body. Some religions see the body as where the [[soul]] lives. Some see the body as like a [[church]]. This is because a church is where people [[worship]] [[God]]. These people think God should be worshiped inside people. Some religions think the body is made from [[chakras]] that connect us to the [[universe]].\n* [[Medicine]] sees the body like a [[machine]].  [[Medical doctor|Doctors]] want to fix problems with the body.  They study how to fix the problems, called [[disease]]s.

Air can be trapped in the fur, or oil can be secreted by the skin. Both these methods prevent the rain or water from  making the body too cold. Aquatic mammals in cold waters usually have blubber (fat) under the skin, and almost no hair.\n*Defence: hair is modified in mammals like [[porcupines]], for protection.\n*Hair colouring can perform different functions. It helps to [[camouflage]] in some animals, and to signal to others of the same [[species]] in some other animals. Examples are: signalling to females for mating purposes and signalling to others for territory control. Signalling danger to other species ([[aposematic]] colouring) is also done by, for example, [[skunk]]s.\n*Animals can change their hair so they look bigger, or more threatening. This can also be used for mating; which is the case with [[lion]]s, for example. Also, the male lions' mane also protects their neck from damage when fighting other males."

Some kinds of lipids are [[hormone]]s, which send messages from one cell to another.\n* Proteins, long chains of [[amino acid]]s, have many purposes. They fold into complex shapes because their amino acids interact. Proteins are involved in many chemical reactions, to make them go faster.\n* Nucleic acids, including [[DNA]] and [[RNA]], are long chains of [[nucleotide]]s. There are only four kinds of nucleotides in each chain, but they are the instructions for life, like a language. Each three nucleotides tell the cell to make one amino acid.

Law	*'''Medical law''' is the body of '''laws''' concerning the rights and responsibilities of '''medical''' professionals and their patients. The main areas of focus for '''medical law''' include confidentiality, negligence and other torts related to '''medical''' treatment (especially '''medical''' malpractice), and criminal '''law''' and '''ethics'''.\n**Physician-Patient Privilege protects the patient's private conversations with a medical physician (doctor), this also extends to their personal information (like their contact details) shared with medical personnel.\n* [[Property]] law states the rights and obligations that a person has when they buy, sell, or rent homes and land (called [[real property]] or [[real property|realty]]), and objects (called [[personal property]]).\n** [[Intellectual property]]  (IP) law involves the rights people have over things they create, such as art, music, and literature. This is called [[copyright]]. It also protects inventions that people make, by a kind of law called [[patent]]. It also covers the rights people have to the names of a company or a distinctive mark or logo. This is called [[trademark]].\n* Trust law (business Law) sets out the rules for money that is put into an [[investment]], such as pension funds that people save up for their retirement. It involves many different types of law, including administrative and property law.\n*[[Tort law]] helps people to make claims for [[money|compensation]] (repayment) when someone hurts them or hurts their property.\n*[[Crime|Criminal law]] is used by the government to prevent people from breaking laws, and punish people who do break them.\n*[[Constitutional law]] deals with the important rights of the government, and its relationship with the people. It mainly involves the interpretation of a [[constitution]], including things like the [[Separation of powers]] of the different branches of government.\n**A [[court order]] is an official proclamation by a judge that defines and authorizes the carrying out of certain steps for one or more parties to a case.\n*Administrative law is used by ordinary citizens who want to challenge decisions made by governments. It also involves things like regulations, and the operation of the [[Public administration|administrative agencies]]. \n*[[International law]] is used to set out rules on how countries can act in areas such as trade, the environment, or military action. The [[Geneva Conventions]] on the conduct of war and the [[Roerich Pact]] are examples of international law.\n*[[Custom]] and tradition are practices that are widely adopted and agreed upon in a society, thought often not in a written form. Custom and tradition can be enforced in courts and are sometimes considered as part of the legal reasoning in matters decided in courts. In some societies and cultures all law is or was custom and tradition, though this is increasingly rare although there are some parts of the world where custom tradition are still binding or even the predominant form of law, for example tribal lands or failed states.

May	"* The floral [[symbol]] of May is the [[Rosa chinensis]].\n* May is the only month that never begins ([[June]] is the other) nor ends ([[September]] is the other) on the same day of the week as any other months within any calendar year.\n* Along with [[March]], May is one of two months in the [[English language]] that start with 'M' and have an 'A' as their second letter. They surround the [[month]] of [[April]].\n* In the [[English language]], May has the shortest name of all the months of the year.\n* The [[Astrology|astrological]] signs for May are [[Taurus]] ([[April 21]] to [[May 20]]) and [[Gemini (astrology)|Gemini]] ([[May 21]] to [[June 20]]): Additionally, in the English language, May is the only month of the year whose two astrological signs don't share any letters in common.\n* May is the second of three months in a row, in the [[English language]], that can also be a [[female]] given name, along with [[April]] and [[June]].\n*[[May 1]] is the only day in May to be entirely within the first third of the [[calendar]] year.\n* ""May"" backwards is ""[[Yam]]"", the name of a [[fruit]].\n* Two 20th century [[President of the United States|US President]]s were born in May - [[Harry S. Truman]] ([[May 8]]) and [[John F. Kennedy]] ([[May 29]]).\n* No [[President of the United States]], to-date, has died in May, though [[James Buchanan]] narrowly avoided doing so, dying on the morning of [[June 1]], [[1868]]."
Music	"* Music often has ''[[pitch (music)|pitch]]''. This means high and low [[note (music)|notes]]. [[Tune]]s are made of notes that go up or down or stay on the same pitch.\n* Music often has ''[[rhythm]]''. Rhythm is the way the musical sounds and silences are put together in a sequence. Every tune has a rhythm that can be tapped. Music usually has a regular beat.\n* Music often has ''[[dynamics (music)|dynamics]]''. This means whether it is quiet or loud or somewhere in between.\n* Music often has ''[[timbre]]''. This is a French word (pronounced the French way: ""TAM-br""). The ""timbre"" of a sound is the way that a sound is interesting. The sort of sound might be harsh, gentle, dry, warm, or something else. Timbre is what makes a [[clarinet]] sound different from an [[oboe]], and what makes one person's [[voice]] sound different from another person."

Microsoft	*[[Microsoft Windows]] is an [[operating system]], which means that it is the basic software that makes people's computers work and lets other programs work.  The majority of desktop and [[laptop]] computers run Windows, and so do some [[tablet computer]]s and a few [[smartphone]]s. The latest version of Windows is [[Windows 10]]. The latest server version is [[Windows Server 2019]].\n*[[Microsoft Office]] is an [[office suite]].  It lets people write documents on their computer with [[Microsoft Word]], make charts and graphs with [[Microsoft Excel]], make presentations with [[Microsoft PowerPoint]], and send email with [[Microsoft Outlook]]. [[Microsoft Sharepoint]] is a server tool included in Microsoft Office (2007, 2013). Microsoft Expression series was a web development tool.\n*[[Internet Explorer]] is a piece of software that lets people look at things online (known as [[web browser|browsing]]) and download things from the [[Internet]]. In 2015, it was replaced by [[Microsoft Edge]].\n*Microsoft also makes other programs for the Internet.  Many of them are called [[Windows Live]] services, with the name Windows Live put in front of the old name of the service, like Windows Live [[Hotmail]].  After 2012, the Windows Live name was less used.\n* Microsoft [[Bing]] is an internet [[search engine]] for finding things online.  Bing Maps shows [[map]]<nowiki/>s.\n* [[MS-DOS]] is the first existing operating system developed by Microsoft, used for primitive computers and terminals.\n* [[Minecraft]] and many other programs have been bought by Microsoft and developed further.
Microsoft	"*[[Outlook.com]] is a [[webmail]] service. When Microsoft created this service in 1996, it was called [[Hotmail]]. It is used to send and receive [[email]], manage a [[calendar]] of events and tasks, and a list of contacts (such as [[phone number]]s and [[email address]]es).\n*[[OneDrive]] is a [[file hosting service]]. It was started in 2007 and was called ""SkyDrive"" at the time. Users can upload files to a [[web server]] and get them on a variety of devices, including PCs and [[mobile device]]s.\n*[[Skype]] is a [[Voice over Internet Protocol|VoIP]] and [[social media]] service. It was not created by Microsoft, but by a company called Skype SARL, which was later bought out by Microsoft. The Skype program or [[mobile app]] lets people make [[phone call]]s through the Internet to other Skype users for free and, for a fee, [[landline]] phones. \n*[[LinkedIn]] is a [[social networking service]] for people with professional [[job]]s. Like Skype, it was not created by Microsoft but by another company which Microsoft later bought. The site lets people post information about their jobs and skills to help [[employer]]s look for new people to [[wikt:hire|hire]].\n*[[MSN]] is a [[web portal]] where people can read [[news]] and get information about different topics. It was created in 1995 and at one point its services were made under the [[brand]] name of ""Windows Live"". MSN used to have an [[instant messaging]] service, MSN Messenger, but that has since become part of Skype.\n*[[Bing]] is a [[search engine]] similar to [[Google]]. It used to be under the MSN brand and was later known as Live Search, but became its own service in 2009. Bing is known for the different images that appear on the background of its home page."

Mechanistic_paradigm	"*In [[physics]] it presents [[atom]]s as made of [[particle physics|particles]] in preference to say the [[wave theory of light]].  In fact, both the particle and wave view are required to explain everything light does, but are rarely presented as equals.  Many physics students graduate fully understanding the [[hydrogen bomb]] but having no clear idea of how [[musical instrument]]s work.\n*In [[astrophysics]] it assumes that the [[universe]] is like [[clockwork]] and works on its own without our choice making any difference - this fits [[relativity]] but is not easy to combine with [[quantum mechanics]].\n*In [[cosmology]] it accepts [[models of our universe]] more easily if reject the [[continuous creation]] of [[matter]], [[energy]] or any new ""other universes"".\n*In [[chemistry]] it assumes that [[molecule]]s are like [[building block]]s, and have no unpredictable or strange and unique effects when combined.  This is the basic assumption of [[mechanosynthesis]] which some scientists think will create a [[molecular assembler]].\n*In [[biology]] it assumes that everything about life - all of [[biochemistry]] - is predictable from [[chemistry]] and [[physics]].\n*Believers tend to regard [[ecology]] and [[psychology]] as ""less scientific"" than [[physics]], [[chemistry]] and [[biology]].\n*Believers may reject ideas like [[psychoneuroimmunology]], [[Gaia philosophy]] or [[Fecund universes]] for no scientific reason, simply because these theories assume ""higher level phenomena"" sometimes drive lower levels.\n*[[Greedy Reductionism]] may be more likely among believers in mechanistic ideas.  For instance, they may want to always see things as made of smaller, even invisible, parts that no one can see or prove is real - like in [[string theory]].\n*For this reason, when they work in [[psychology]], they may prefer theories like [[behaviorism]] that deny [[free will]] and try to explain [[human behaviour]] as a function of [[biology]].\n*The [[philosophy of mathematics]] of most believers is a form of [[Platonism]].

Number	"* People use symbols to represent numbers; they call them [[numeral]]s. Common places where numerals are used are for labeling, as in [[telephone number]]s, for ordering, as in [[serial number]]s, or to put a unique identifier, as in an [[ISBN]], a unique number that can identify a [[book]].\n* [[Cardinal number]]s are used to measure how many items are in a [[set]]. For example, {A,B,C} has size ""3"".\n* [[Ordinal number]]s are used to specify a certain element in a [[set]] or [[sequence]] (''first'', ''second'', ''third'')."
Number	* [[1 (number)|1]] – one\n* [[10 (number)|10]] – ten\n* 100 – one [[hundred]]\n* 1,000 – one [[thousand]]\n* [[1,000,000]] – one [[million]]
Number	* 1,000,000,000 – one [[billion]] (short scale), one [[milliard]] (long scale)\n* 1,000,000,000,000 – one [[trillion]] (short scale), one [[billion]] (long scale)\n* 1,000,000,000,000,000 – one [[quadrillion]] (short scale), one [[names for large numbers|billiard]] (long scale)
Number	* Adding a negative number to another is the same as taking away the positive number with the same numerals. For example, 5 + (−3) is the same as 5 − 3, and equals 2.\n* Taking away a negative number from another is the same as adding the positive number with the same numerals. For example, 5 − (−3) is the same as 5 + 3, and equals 8.\n* [[multiplication|Multiplying]] two negative numbers together produces a positive number. For example, −5 times −3 is 15.\n* Multiplying a negative number by a positive number, or multiply a positive number by a negative number, produces a negative result. For example, 5 times −3 is −15.
Number	* The rational numbers, including integers\n* The irrational numbers
Number	* The sum of two imaginary numbers is found by pulling out (factoring out) the '''i'''. For example, 2'''i''' + 3'''i''' = (2 + 3)'''i''' = 5'''i'''.\n* The difference of two imaginary numbers is found similarly.  For example, 5'''i''' − 3'''i''' = (5 − 3)'''i''' = 2'''i'''.\n* When multiplying two imaginary numbers, remember that '''i''' × '''i''' (i<sup>2</sup>) is −1.  For example, 5'''i''' × 3'''i''' = ( 5 × 3 ) × ( '''i''' × '''i''' ) = 15 × (−1) = −15.
Number	* To add two complex numbers, add the real and imaginary parts separately. For example, (2 + 3'''i''') + (3 + 2'''i''')  = (2 + 3) + (3 + 2)'''i'''= 5 + 5'''i'''.\n* To subtract one complex number from another, subtract the real and imaginary parts separately. For example, (7 + 5'''i''') − (3 + 3'''i''') = (7 − 3) + (5 − 3)'''i''' = 4 + 2'''i'''.

Natural_resource	*A [[renewable resource]] is one which can be used again and again. For example, [[soil]], [[sunlight]] and [[water]] are renewable resources. However, in some circumstances, even water is not renewable easily. Wood is a renewable resource, but it takes time to renew and in some places people use the land for something else. Soil, if it blows away, is not easy to renew.\n*A [[non-renewable resource]] is a resource that does not grow and come back, or a resource that would take a very long time to come back. For example, [[coal]] is a non-renewable resource. When we use coal, there is less coal afterward.  The non-renewable resource can be used directly (for example, burning oil to cook), or we can find a renewable resource to use (for example, using wind energy to make [[electricity]] to cook).

October	"* Because [[Daylight Saving Time]] ends in October in some Northern Hemisphere countries, it is sometimes seen as the ""longest"" month there.\n* in a [[common year]], [[October 31]] falls on the same day of the week as [[February 28]] while in a [[leap year]], it falls on the same day of the week as [[February 29]].\n*[[October 1]] is the only day in October to start within the third quarter of the [[calendar year]].\n* This month is tied with [[November]] as the months with the most births of [[President of the United States|US Presidents]] as of January 20, 2021: with six - [[Jimmy Carter]] ([[October 1]]), [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] ([[October 4]]), [[Chester A. Arthur]] ([[October 5]]), [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] ([[October 14]]), [[Theodore Roosevelt]] ([[October 27]]) and [[John Adams]] ([[October 30]]).\n* October's [[flower]] is the [[Calendula]].\n* One of October's [[birthstone]]s is the [[opal]]. The meaning of the opal is hope. The other birthstone of October is the [[pink tourmaline]].\n* The [[Astrology|astrological]] signs for October are [[Libra (astrology)|Libra]] ([[September 22]] to [[October 21]]) and [[Scorpio (astrology)|Scorpio]] ([[October 22]] to [[November 21]])."
1_(number)	* Any number ''n'' multiplied by 1 equals that number: ''n'' × 1 = ''n.'' For example, 7 × 1 = 7.\n* Any number ''n'' divided by 1 equals that number: ''n'' / 1 = ''n''. For example, 7 / 1 = 7.\n* Any number ''n'', other than 0, divided by itself always equals 1: ''n'' / ''n'' = 1. For example: 7 / 7 = 1.\n* 1 cannot be divided with any other number so that the result is a [[natural number]].
1_(number)	"* In [[Germany]] and [[Austria]], one is the grade for ""very good"". It is the best grade of six possible grades in Germany, and the best of five possible grades in Austria. In the [[Netherlands]], one is the lowest grade, and ten the highest and the best. In [[Poland]], one is also the lowest grade, but the highest is six.\n* In [[numerology]], the number one is a symbol for everything ([[unity]]), the beginning, and [[God]]."

Orthography	* Spelling, though important, is less important than how the language is used in practice. The differences between British and American English in use are more to do with [[idiom]], [[slang]] and [[vocabulary]] than they are to do with spelling. In this respect, spelling in writing or print is a bit like [[pronunciation]] in [[speech]]. They are the necessary outer clothes, but the inner substance is more important.\n* In Wikipedia (note the spelling), articles may be in either American or British English, but should be consistent within each article. More details: [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style]]

Philosophy	* what should we do in our lives?\n* What happens to a soul after death, how does a soul enter into the body before death?\n*Why are we born?\n*Why should we live?\n*Why are there so many hurdles in life?\n*How do we overcome suffering?\n*What is the importance of the material life?\n*Will the universe exist forever?\n* What is [[beauty]]?\n* Do we have [[free will]]?\n* Does [[God]] exist?\n* Does the [[world]] around us [[existence|exist]]?\n* What is [[truth]]? \n* What is [[evil]]?\n* What is the [[relationship]] between [[mind]] and [[body]]?\n* What is the [[meaning of life]]?
Philosophy	* What is the world that we see around us? (What is [[reality]]?)\n** Is there more to the world than just what we see or hear? \n** If nobody sees something happening, does that mean that it did not happen?\n** What does it mean to say that something is possible? Do other worlds exist?\n* Is there anything very special about being a [[human being]] or being [[life|alive]] at all?\n** If not, why do some people think that there is?\n* What is [[Space (physics)|space]]? What is [[time]]?
Philosophy	* What is a [[mind]]?\n* What is a [[body]]?\n* What is [[consciousness]]?\n* Do people make choices, or can they only choose to do one thing?

Philosophy	* What is [[beauty]]? What if one person thinks a painting is beautiful, but another person thinks the painting is ugly? Can the painting be beautiful and ugly at the same time?\n* Are [[truth|true]] things beautiful?\n* Are [[goodness|good]] things beautiful?\n* What is [[art]]? We commonly think that a [[sculpture]] in a [[museum]] is art. If a sculptor sculpts a sculpture of a rock from clay, and puts it in a museum, many would call it art. But what if a person picks up a rock from the ground - is the rock a piece of art?
Philosophy	* What do the words we use mean?\n* How can we say things (especially [[idea]]s) in a way that only has one meaning?\n* Can all ideas be expressed using [[language]]?\n* How does the [[truth]] of an [[argument]]'s [[premise]] affect the truth of its conclusion?\n* How can we reason correctly?
Philosophy	* What has value?\n* Is time really money? or have we made it so?\n* Does love, beauty, or justice hold any value?

Police	* Preventing crime and protecting the public. They do this by [[patrol]]ling on foot in [[uniform]] and in police cars. This can stop some forms of [[crime|criminal behavior]].\n* Responding to crimes. When someone calls the police to say that a crime is happening, they must send some police officers to arrive at the scene very quickly. They will try to stop the crime and catch the person doing it.\n* Investigating crime. This means that the police try to find out who did the crime.\n* Arresting and detaining suspects. When the police believe that someone has committed a crime, the police [[arrest]] them, take them to the police station and ask them questions. However, it is the [[prosecutor]]s and not the police who have the final say on whether a suspect gets charged.\n* To help with emergencies or problems that are not crimes. This may be car accidents, fires, or people who are sick, hurt or lost. The police work with [[firefighter]]s, [[ambulance]]s, and rescuers. They might direct [[traffic]], help lost children, or give traffic [[citation|ticket]]s.
Police	*Patrol officers travel through their area. They may travel by foot, on bicycle or motorcycle, or in marked cars. The cars have warning lights and sirens that can be used. The sirens make a loud sound. Patrol officers enforce [[motor vehicle]] and [[crime|criminal]] laws. In some locations patrol officers manage the local [[jail]].\n*Detectives work on [[investigation]]s that are more complex. They try to find [[fraud]], [[illegal drug]]s, and [[Sexual intercourse|sex]] crimes like [[prostitution]], [[human trafficking]], and [[rape]]. Prostitution is not a crime in all countries.

A spring is water that flows out from under the ground.\n* The source of a river may be a lake where lots of water from small streams gathers when it rains or snows.\n* A river may begin in mountains where there is snow. The melting snow runs together to form a small stream that runs down the mountain. As more little streams run in, the main stream gets bigger, until it forms a river.\n* Some rivers flow from hills where there is no snow, but lots of rain.\n* Some rivers only flow after there has been rain near the head water.
River	* Rivers give water for drinking, bathing and washing clothes.\n* Rivers give water for [[cattle]] and other animals to drink and for people to grow plants.\n* Rivers give [[Product (consumer goods)|products]] that are useful to people such as fish for food, [[clay]] for bricks and [[Reed (plant)|reeds]] to make the roofs of houses.\n* Rivers can be used for transporting people, crops and other goods by boat.\n* Rivers can be used to give power to turn machinery such as water [[watermill|mills]].\n* Rivers give water for factories that make cloth, steel and many other products.\n* Rivers sometimes have dams to hold the water for people to drink, or to make electricity.\n* Rivers can be used for [[leisure]] and [[sport]]s such as swimming, boating, fishing and just walking by the river.\n* Rivers often have beautiful scenery. Many painters, story-tellers and poets have painted or written about rivers.\n* Rivers are sometimes turned into canals.

Coincidentally, it is also the ninth month. September is the only month of the year in the English language to have as many letters in its name as its numeric calendar position.\n* September is the first of four months in-a-row to have a name ending in ""ber"". ([[October]], [[November]] and [[December]] are the other three)\n* [[September 1]] is the only day in September during a [[common year]] to start within the middle third of the [[calendar]] year.\n* It is the least common [[month]] for [[birthday]]s among [[President of the United States|US Presidents]], with one, [[William Howard Taft]] ([[September 15]]).\n* Among [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Ministers of Australia]], September is the most common month for birthdays, with seven."

[[Chiang Kai-shek]] sends in the army to restore order, killing tens of thousands. Some Taiwanese began the [[Taiwan independence movement]].\n* 1949:\n** The Nationalists (KMT) lose the civil war, which resumed after World War II, and escape to the island of Taiwan. They set up [[Taipei]] as the temporary capital of Republic of China (ROC).\n** The Communist Party of China (CCP) establishes Beijing as the capital of The [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC).  \n*1951: Japan signs the [[Treaty of San Francisco]] (1951) with U.S.\n*1971: Taiwan is expelled from the United Nations and replaced with the [[People's Republic of China|PRC]]\n* 1979: The KMT government jails many [[democracy]] activists who opposed it ([[Kaohsiung Incident]]).\n* 1986: The [[Democratic Progressive Party]] (DPP) is formed; it is the first party to form in the ROC other than the KMT.

Universe	"* If the Universe is a closed sphere, it will stop expanding. The Universe will do the opposite of that and become a [[Gravitational singularity|singularity]] for another [[Big Bang]]. This is the Big Crunch or Big Bounce theory.\n* If the Universe is an opened sphere, it will speed up the expansion. After 22,000,000,000 (22 billion) years, the Universe will [[wikt:Rip|rip]] [[Wikt:Apart|apart]] with the [[wikt:Force|force]]. This is the Big Rip theory.\n* If the Universe is flat, it will expand forever. All stars will lose their [[wikt:Energy|energy]] for that and become a [[dwarf star]]. \n*After a [[googol]] years, the [[black hole]]s will also be gone. This is the Heat Death or Big Freeze theory.  \n*A chance ""Boltzmann's brain"" may appear, and random quantum fluctuations and quantum tunnelling could generate a new Big Bang after an incredible amount of time. Over an infinite time there could also be an entropy decrease by [[Poincaré recurrence]] theorem or by thermal fluctuations."

Year	"* a '''solar''' year is based on the [[season]]s. The Gregorian calendar is based on the solar year.  The solar year is 365 days long. \n** A tropical year (also known as a solar year) is the time that the Sun takes to return to the same position in the cycle of seasons, as seen from Earth; for example, the time from vernal equinox to vernal equinox, or from summer solstice to summer solstice. The word ""tropical"" in this sense comes from the Greek ''tropikos'' meaning ""turn"". \n* a '''lunar''' year is based on the [[moon]] and is usually 12 [[lunar month]]s (29 days, 12 [[hour]]s, 44 [[minute]]s each) or 354 days long.\n* a '''sidereal''' year measures the time between when a selected [[star|fixed star]] is highest in the [[wikt:night|night]] [[sky]].\n* an '''anomalistic year''' is the difference between the times when the Earth gets closest to the sun.\n* an '''eclipse''' year is the time between node passages. This is when the sun moves through a part of the sky where it is possible for the sun, Earth and moon to be in a line. It is also when [[eclipse]]s can happen."
Yard_(disambiguation)	"*[[Yard (land)]], an open space around a building. For instance, the space around a school is called a ''school yard''. A yard is used by humans and their pets.

Climate	* [[Polar climate]] (also called '''boreal climate'''), has long, usually very cold winters, and short summers.\n* [[Temperate]] climates have four [[season]]s. Some of the countries which have a temperate climate are: most of the [[Europe]]an countries.\n* [[Desert climate|Deserts]]. They just have one or two seasons such as: [[Saudi Arabia]] and most of the African countries.\n* [[Tropical climate]]s have warm temperature and only two seasons; wet and dry. An example of a place with a tropical climate is the [[Amazon Rainforest]] in [[Brazil]].\n* The [[Mediterranean climate]] is usually hot and dry in summer, and is cool and wet in winter. An example of a country with a Mediterranean climate is [[Spain]].

Fold_(geology)	* symmetrical fold: two limbs are of equal steepness\n* Asymmetrical fold: one limb is steeper than the other\n* Overfold: one limb is pushed over the other\n* Recumbent fold: two limbs are nearly parallel\n* Overthrust fold: compressional force is so great that the rock strata are broken and slide over the other.
Fold_(geology)	* [[Himalayas]]\n* [[Alps]]\n* [[Andes]]\n* [[Rocky Mountains]]
Volcanism	* Batholiths: Have large scale magma that has been solidified at the base of the mountain.\n* Dyke: Is a small scale magma cooled within the earths crust that stands vertically to the existing rocks.\n* Sill: Is a small scale magma cooled near the earths surface that lies horizontally to the existing rocks.\n* Laccolith: A small scale magma that pushes the overlying layers of rocks to form a dome shaped structure.
Volcanism	* [[Gas]] - [[sulphur]], [[hydrogen]], [[carbon dioxide]] and [[hot steam]] ([[geysers]]). When uprising magma decreases in pressure suddenly, gases within magma explode to the Earth's surface and cause destruction.\n* [[Solid]] - [[pyroclast]]. Mainly composed of: country rock,<ref>meaning the rock native to an area</ref> fragments of solidified [[lava]] and fine materials (volcanic [[Volcanic ash|ash]] and dust). It can be classified by size into volcanic bombs, volcanic blocks, [[lapilli]], volcanic ash and volcanic dust. \n* [[Liquid]] - [[lava]], [[hot spring]]s.
Volcanism	* [[Caldera]]: a large depression in a former volcanic site. When it is filled with water it is called a 'caldera lake'. \n* Composite cones: a large volcanic mountain formed by solidified lava on the surface.\n* [[Geyser]]s: eruption of hot water and steam shooting into the air at regular intervals.\n* [[Hot spring]]s: springs of hot water that flow out continuously without shooting up into the air.

IP_address	* Unicast addresses:  The address is assigned to one specific device. This is the most common case, most addresses are unicast addresses.\n* Broadcast addresses: Addresses all computers on the same network. There are certain cases where this is useful, such as to obtain a new address automatically. The sender sends the data once, and the devices used for routing the data make copies, as needed. \n* Multicast addresses: This case is similar to the broadcast case above: Some devices are interested in receiving certain data, and the network copies the data as needed. The big difference to the broadcast case above is that all devices connected to the broadcast network see the data sent using broadcast. With multicast, devices need to subscribe to see a given content. The devices on the same network that are not subscribed will not see the content.
IP_address	* Leading zeroes can be left out: '''''2001:0db8:00b8:0008:0000:0000:0000:0001''''' becomes '''''2001:db8:b8:8:0:0:0:1'''''\n* Any number of sequential, all-zero 'chunks' may be compressed to simply ::. This can be done only once in the same address: '''''2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:0001''''' could be written as '''''2001:db8::1'''''

Plural	"*Singulars ending in <u>s</u> are usually the same in plural: ''species'', ''mumps'', ''innings'' and so on. However, proper nouns ending in 's' take add 'es' in plural: ''Jones'' becomes ''the Joneses''. \n*Compound words add the plural to the noun part: <u>sons</u>-in-law, Lord <u>Mayors</u>, <u>Courts</u> Martial.\n*Singulars ending in <u>y</u> become <u>ies</u> in the plural if a [[consonant]] is before the suffix: <u>day</u> becomes <u>days</u>, but <u>spy</u> becomes <u>spies</u>. Personal names are again exceptions: the plural of <u>Mary</u> is <u>Marys</u>.\n*Singulars ending in <u>f</u> usually changes to <u>ves</u>: dwarf to dwarves, leaf to leaves, and so on.\n*Special cases: some plurals just have to be learnt. The plural of ''person'' is normally ''people'', but sometimes ''persons'' is used.\n*Invariant nouns: <br/>The [[common name]]s of animals is often used as both singular and plural. One can say ""We shot grouse today"" correctly no matter what number were killed. With ""fish"" there is a choice. The traditional English usage is that the word is used for both singular and plural, but American usage seems to prefer <u>fishes</u> as the plural. <br/>With groups of animals, one uses the singular, as in a herd of bison or a [[shoal]] of herring. However, if the animals are known as individuals then, for example, we feed the ducks, or stroke our cats. There are other cases where there is no plural at all, as with sheep, salmon, deer. <br/>Other general words which add no suffix in plural are ''aircraft'' and ''offspring''. Some look like singular but are always plural, such as ''vermin'', ''livestock'', ''cattle'', ''people''."

Association_football	* The side which scores the most goals wins. If scores are equal, the result is a draw. In cup competitions, there may be extra time and penalties to determine a winner.\n* The officials in a football game are a [[referee]] and two [[Linesman (soccer)|linesmen]]. \n* Goals are scored by getting the ball into the  opponents' goal, more than halfway across the line.\n** Referees have access to goal-line cameras to decide close cases.\n** The ''[[offside rule]]'' means that there have to be at least two defenders between the attacker and the defenders' goal when the attacker's teammate passes the ball to him/her. (This is not a complete summary: the rule is complex). Usually, one of the two defenders is the goalkeeper.\n* Players may not use their hands or arms (handball), except the goalkeeper, who may use them within his own ''penalty area'' (''penalty areas'' are in front of both goals).\n* The ball is out of play if it crosses the field boundaries.\n** If a player hits the ball out of play at the side of the field, the other team gets to throw the ball back into play (a ''[[Throw-in|throw in]]'').\n** If a player hits the ball out of play at their end of the field, the other team kicks the ball back into play from the corner (a ''[[corner kick]]'').\n** If a player kicks the ball out of play at the other end of the field, the other team kicks the ball back into play from directly in front of the goal (a ''[[goal kick]]'').\n* Football is a game of two halves. Each half is 45 minutes.  The referee may add time to the end of each half when play is delayed due to injuries or substitutions.  There is an interval of ten minutes between halves.\n* Each team is allowed up to three substitutes from the bench during the course of a game. No player substituted can return during the game.
Association_football	* Players may not trip or push each other (a ''foul'').\n* Players may not hold each other or stop other players from getting to the ball (''obstruction'').\n* When a player scores he/she is not allowed to jump into the crowd. If he/she does they will get a yellow card. The same applies to lifting or removing their shirt in celebration.\n* Players must not abuse referees in any way (verbally or physically).\n* Players who commit bad fouls get shown a yellow card. Players who commit really bad fouls, or get shown two yellow cards in the same game, get shown a [[red card]]. Players who get shown a red card get sent off the field and cannot finish playing the game. In some competitions (like the Premier League in [[England]]) you miss the next game (suspended) if you get a red card, or pick up 5 yellow cards during the season.
